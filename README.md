Cat Clicker Premium has been built using Knockout JS. 

List of cat names appear on the screen. When the user selects a cat, the image updates to the current cat. User can click on the cat and the click count increases. Once click count reaches certain number the stage of the cat changes. The click count is saved when the user clicks on different cat name.
